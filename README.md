## Overview of Election Audit
The purpose of the project is to give a Colorado board of elections employee, Tom, an audit of a recent local elections. 

1. Calculate total number of votes cast
2. Calculate total number of votes for each candidate
3. Calculate percentage of votes for each candidate
4. Determine the winner of the election based on popular votes.

## Challenge Summary: 
This challenge script can be extremely valuable to many elections and companies. The code is clean and conconcise. I explained every code prior to implementing the code to give readers an idea of what the code actually does. We can modify the code to help with analyzing customer votes for new features as well as election votes for new candidates.
